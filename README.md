## 📖 Example Conversion

**Input:**  
```
59.7737 (Decimal) → Binary
```

**Output:**  
```
Result: 111011.11000100110011₂
```

**Steps:**  
```
Step 1: Convert integer part (59) → binary:
59 ÷ 2 = 29 remainder 1
29 ÷ 2 = 14 remainder 1
14 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 0
7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1
3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1
Integer result = 111011

Step 2: Convert fractional part (0.7737) → binary (approx):
0.7737 × 2 = 1.5474 → 1
0.5474 × 2 = 1.0948 → 1
0.0948 × 2 = 0.1896 → 0
0.1896 × 2 = 0.3792 → 0
0.3792 × 2 = 0.7584 → 1
0.7584 × 2 = 1.5168 → 1
Fractional result ≈ .110001

Final Answer = 111011.110001₂
```
